Revised Zombie Horde Quick Rules, by Kyle Burke <paithanq@gmail.com>.

The full rules are on the original page where the game was defined.  Here are the quick rules I use to remind myself how to play.  There are some changes here that make it more fun to play as well.



* Survivors have 40 life total.

* 25 cards from Zombie Horde deck for each player.  (So currently it only goes up to 4 players.)

* Survivors don't draw on their first turn.

* Difficulty levels:

  - Novice: Survivors take 4 turns before the zombies go.
  
  - Normal: 3 turns
  
  - Challenge: 2 turns
  
  - Professional: 1 turn
  
  - Legendary: Zombies go first.
